            <p>
              To tell you more about myself, with my career I want to become a software developer. 
              I have 2 years of previous experience working in IT while I was in college. I also have 
              over five years of experience working in an office setting. To add to my experience, 
              I graduated college at the University of Colorado Denver with a Bachelor of Science in 
              Business Administration Management. I am currently attending the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp 
              where I am learning even more code writing skills. In the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp, 
              I learned how to work with others on the same coding projects, how to develop both front end and backend, 
              and how to learn new skills, languages, or frameworks on the fly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my favorite hobbies is writing code as it is my dream job; the type of job I would do for free. 
              I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, APIs, GIT, bootstrap, XML, Java, Node.js, PHP, Android Programming, 
              Python, C#, relation databases, SQL databases, NGINX Servers, setting up both email servers and web servers, CentOS 7, 
              Ubuntu, Active Directory, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio. If you would like to see examples of my code, please check out 
              the app section of my portfolio and my GitHub account which is linked in the portfolio as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I consider myself to be a strong candidate for a job position as a developer because of my previous experience in IT 
              combined with my business savviness from being a Business Management major. I am eager to combine my tech experience with 
              my business experience and coding skill set to become an elite developer.
